# Electronic Health Records Alexa

We are focusing on the problem of managing Electronic Health Records, also known as EHRs. EHRs are still not available in many developing countries and the busy environment in the medical field makes it difficult for healthcare professionals to keep it updated. Now in the age of Alexa, these professionals now just have to talk to Alexa and tell her all the records they wanna update or fetch and Alexa will do the rest. Yes, they just have to tell the information and Alexa will update the EHRs.
